- [x] security and fail-closed tests listed
- [x] release-blocking behaviors listed

## Documentation Site

- [x] docs scaffold installed

- [x] generated docs placeholders replaced or tracked for replacement before validation

## Pre-Coding Gate

- [x] `docs/research.md` is no longer placeholder-only
- [x] `docs/dependency-analysis.md` is no longer placeholder-only
